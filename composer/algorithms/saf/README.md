"# SAF Algorithm

The SAF (Stochastic Average Flatness) algorithm is a training algorithm designed to find flat minima in the loss landscape of a neural network. The algorithm is implemented in the `SAF` class in the `saf.py` file.

## Description

The SAF algorithm works by adjusting the learning rate and using a temperature parameter to control the sharpness of the minima found. The algorithm also uses an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to smooth the training process.

## Usage

To use the SAF algorithm, you need to create an instance of the `SAF` class and pass the necessary parameters to the constructor. Here is an example:

```python
saf = SAF(
    training_set=training_set,
    network=network,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    epochs=10,
    iterations_per_epoch=100,
    saf_starting_epoch=5,
    saf_coefficients=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    temperature=0.1,
    saf_hyperparameter=0.5,
    ema_decay_factor=0.9
)
```

In this example, `training_set` is the dataset to be used for training, `network` is the neural network whose weights are to be optimized, `learning_rate` is the learning rate for the optimization, `epochs` is the number of epochs for the training, `iterations_per_epoch` is the number of iterations per epoch, `saf_starting_epoch` is the epoch at which to start SAF, `saf_coefficients` are the coefficients for the SAF algorithm, `temperature` is the temperature parameter for the SAF algorithm, `saf_hyperparameter` is the hyperparameter for the SAF algorithm, and `ema_decay_factor` is the decay factor for the EMA.

After creating the `SAF` instance, you can call the `forward` method to start the training process:

```python
saf.forward()
```

Please note that the `forward` method is currently a placeholder and will be implemented in the future.

## Testing

The `test_saf.py` file contains tests for the SAF algorithm. You can run these tests to verify the correct operation of the algorithm.

## Future Work

The `forward` method of the `SAF` class is currently a placeholder. In the future, this method will be implemented to perform the actual training process according to the SAF algorithm."
